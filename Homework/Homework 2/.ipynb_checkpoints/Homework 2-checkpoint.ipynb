    "## Gradient Descent and Local Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: Tuesday, Feb 16\n",
    "\n",
    "**Points**: 40\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit **one** Python notebook or PDF file for grading. If you submit a PDF, also submit code files.\n",
    "* Your submitted file should include **text explanations** of your work, **well-commented code**, the **outputs** from your code.\n",
    "* Any language I can easily run is acceptable, but I recommend Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are many modifications of gradient decent that can help it run more quickly and more reliably reach effective local minima in the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Read about [momentum](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) and [Nesterov acceleration](https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) and implement both in a gradient decent algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Write an implementation of gradient descent that will automatically test a customizable number of random points as starting points the method.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. For this problem, use the dataset from [GitHub]()\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Modify the loss function of the radial basis function model to include $L^1$ and $L^2$ regularization"
