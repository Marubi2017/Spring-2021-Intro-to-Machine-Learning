    "## Gradient Descent and Local Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: Tuesday, Feb 16\n",
    "\n",
    "**Points**: 35\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit **one** Python notebook or PDF file for grading. If you submit a PDF, also submit code files.\n",
    "* Your file should include **text explanations** of your work, **well-commented code**, and the **outputs** from your code.\n",
    "* Any language I can easily run is acceptable, but I recommend Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "For problems 1 and 3, use the homework 2 dataset from [GitHub](https://github.com/rtwhite1546/Spring-2021-Intro-to-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Homework/data/homework-2-data.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[5 points]** Fit a linear basis function model or a kernel smoothing model to the data and tune the hyperparameters of the model. (Run at least 20 experiments.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[10 points]** There are many modifications of gradient decent that can help it run more quickly and more reliably reach effective local minima in the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Read about [momentum](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) and [Nesterov acceleration](https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) and implement both in a gradient decent algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Write an implementation of gradient descent that will automatically test a customizable number of random points as starting points the method.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. **[20 points]** For this problem, focus on the radial basis functions model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Modify the model to include $L^1$ and $L^2$ regularization, momentum, and Nesterov acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. List *all* the hyperparameters for the model and tune the hyperparameters. (Run at least 20 experiments.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Note:** You should make appropriate use of a train set, a dev set, and a test set in tuning hyperparameters.\n"
